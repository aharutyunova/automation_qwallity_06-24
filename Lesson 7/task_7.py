#1. Write a Python function to find the maximum value of given list(write algorithm).

def max_item(given_list):
    return max(given_list)

print(max_item([1, 8, 9, 30]))


#2.	Write a Python function, which will get few numbers from keyboard, return to sum of them

def sum_of_numbers(list):
    return sum(list)
        
print(sum_of_numbers([1,2,3]))

# Anna - for task 1 and task 2 I would like you write your own algorithm and not use max/sum  :)
#  But from function creation part everything is ok

#3.	Create module  with name fib.py where keep function of Fibonacci, in second .py file import and call it.
