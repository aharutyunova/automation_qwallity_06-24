def fibonacci (x): 
    if x = {0,1}

    # the condition above should print 0 and 1
    return fibonacci (x-1)+(x-2)
    fibonacci(x) for x in range(10)
    #the second return should print the fibonacci sequence for the first 10 numbers and result should be /
    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

# Anna comment
    #  It is ok I didn't expect code soution for this task :)
    #  First condition is correct, what about second condition - why x-1 and x-2? 
    #  at first we should print 0 and 1 and after it each next number should be the sum of previous 2 numbers If you mean this idea qit is correct :)
    # Example
    # x = 0; y =1; z=x+y=1
    # x=y=1; y=z=1; z=x+y=2
    # x=y=1;  y=z=2; z = x+y =3
    # x=y=2;  y=z=3; z = x+y =5
    # etc
