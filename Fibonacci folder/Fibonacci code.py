# Anna comment - The diagram was enouth as we didn't discuss code yet :) But anyway code is correct :)
#  In Diagram only one note - you print only first number, after it you assign 
#    first_member = second_member
# second_member = next_member  but don't print it.
# In the code this part is correct.
