#1. Write a Python function to find the maximum value of given list(write algorithm).

def Maximum_value_func(input_list):
    
    return (max(input_list))

input_list = [3, 5, 6, 8, 56, 34, 67, 89, 100, 488]

print(f"Maximum value is", Maximum_value_func(input_list))

# Anna - you should not use max function, should write your own algorithm to get max, but as a function structure, it is correct

#3.	Create module  with name fib.py where keep function of Fibonacci, in second .py file import and call it.

#Please find it in the Lesson_7 folder


#Anna jan, please also find "date_checker" file in the folder lesson_6_Armine, and please explain why it works wrong, am I going to the right direction?)))
