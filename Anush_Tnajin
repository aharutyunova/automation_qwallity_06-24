# 1. Write a Python program to calculate the length of a string.

my_string = "Here is string for your exercise!"
print(len(my_string))

# Answer` 33

# 2. Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and the last 2 chars from a given a string. 

new_string = "w3resource"

if len(new_string) < 2:
    print("It is failed")
else:
    new_outpute = new_string[:2] + new_string[-2:]
    print(new_outpute)

# Answer` w3ce


#3  Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string.

def new_add(text):
    return text + "ing"
 
 
x = "abc"
print(new_add(x))

#4  Write a Python program to replace ‘cut’ word to ‘dog’

def new(string, word1, word2):
    return string.replace(word1, word2)


x = 'I have a cat and I love it'
word1 = "cat"
word2 = "dog"

res = new(x, word1, word2)
print(res)



7.Write a Python program to which will print the triangle perimeter․ 

def triangel_sum(num1, num2, num3):
    x = num1 + num2 + num3
    return x


print(triangel_sum(3, 4, 7))

#8 Write a Python program to check whether a specified value is contained in a group of values.
  
  def test(x, y):
    return x in y


x = 3
y = [1, 5, 8, 3]

t = -1
k = [1, 5, 8, 3]

print(test(x, y))
print(test(t, k))



#9.	Write a Python program to solve (x + y) * (x + y). 


def new_func(x, y):
    result = (x + y) * (x + y)
    return result


print(new_func(4, 3))


#10. Write a Python program which converts float values to integer, and sum of two values, then result print with reversed order.


def sum(x, y):
    a = int(x)
    b = int(y)
    res = a + b
    print(res)
    res = str(res)
    new = int(res[::-1])
    return new


x = 2.5
y = 13.75

print(sum(x, y))
